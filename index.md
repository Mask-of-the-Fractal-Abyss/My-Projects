### PROJECTS
## Email Bot, Python, Raspberry Pi = Developer:
# JANUARY 2019 – PRESENT
This project is a "precursor" project to my end goal of building a home aide laser cutter. A year ago I decided I wanted to build a laser cutter, and planned several precursor projects I would need to get there. After this robot is complete, I will move onto a lower power laser diode, and in college I will be using a high power CO2 laser tube. Surprisingly my estimate of where I'd be in the process was fairly accurate, and I am on track to finish the lower power laser before I leave for college.

A lot more information on the project in the readme, including goals specific to this project (It’s a lot more exciting than just a precursor project!)

## Cryptodungeon Game, Python = Developer:
# DECEMBER 2018 – PRESENT
This is the fourth iteration of this project. A big feature I initially considered including was the ability to make this turn-based text adventure game multiplayer. Players would email a file containing the entire gamestate, almost like passing chess notation. This is different from traditional multiplayer since it is not dependent on a stable internet connection. Anyone with any access to internet can play the game with anyone else, as long as they can email a single file to them.

Additional information, with game specifics, in the readme.

This is another precursor project. The next stage of the project will be a Cellular-Automata-inspired version, where almost every aspect of the gameplay is determined by a procedurally generated Cellular Automata ruleset.  This is still a precursor of a precursor. The end goal is a non-game project that I am particularly passionate about, and I look forward to seeing a polished product.

## Chess Dynasties, Digital Board Game = Co-Developer:
# JUNE 2018 - PRESENT
This game has an interesting relationship with Super Fortress, in that I met some people online who were already discussing working on a digital version of a very similar game.  My version of the game has since diverged, and is much different, but I am still very much invested in this project.  For this project I have learned some C# for Unity, and continue to expand on my skills in that language.

## Super Fortress, Board Game = Developer:
# JUNE 2016 - DECEMBER 2018
I was inspired to create this chess-like game by one of my friends at Beam Camp.  It has since branched into many iterations but I have finally reached a version I am happy with.  While working on this project, I learned how to use Excel spreadsheets, CSV, and some HTML and CSS.  I also eventually used Python to automatically split a larger pdf of all the cards into a bunch of individual images. I also got to flex some of my creative writing muscles for this project, as each character has their own little unique backstory and fits into the world I built for the game.

Some of the cards I made for this game:
