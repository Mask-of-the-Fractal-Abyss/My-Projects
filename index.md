I work on lots of different projects in my spare time.  I don't finish some of them, but for me it's more about the learning process than creating a completed, pitch-perfect project!

#### Email Bot, Python, Raspberry Pi = Developer:
###### JANUARY 2019 – PRESENT
This project is a "precursor" project to my end goal of building a home aide laser cutter. A year ago I decided I wanted to build a laser cutter, and planned several precursor projects I would need to get there. After this robot is complete, I will move onto a lower power laser diode, and in college I will be using a high power CO2 laser tube. Surprisingly my estimate of where I'd be in the process was fairly accurate, and I am on track to finish the lower power laser before I leave for college.

A lot more information on the project in the readme, including goals specific to this project (It’s a lot more exciting than just a precursor project!)

#### Cryptodungeon Game, Python = Developer:
###### DECEMBER 2018 – PRESENT
This is the fourth iteration of this project. A big feature I initially considered including was the ability to make this turn-based text adventure game multiplayer. Players would email a file containing the entire gamestate, almost like passing chess notation. This is different from traditional multiplayer since it is not dependent on a stable internet connection. Anyone with any access to internet can play the game with anyone else, as long as they can email a single file to them.

Additional information, with game specifics, in the readme.

This is another precursor project. The next stage of the project will be a Cellular-Automata-inspired version, where almost every aspect of the gameplay is determined by a procedurally generated Cellular Automata ruleset.  This is still a precursor of a precursor. The end goal is a non-game project that I am particularly passionate about, and I look forward to seeing a polished product.

#### Super Fortress, Board Game = Developer: 
###### JUNE 2016 - DECEMBER 2018
I was inspired to create this chess-like game by one of my friends at Beam Camp.  It has since branched into many iterations but I have finally reached a version I am happy with.  While working on this project, I learned how to use Excel spreadsheets, CSV, and some HTML and CSS.  I also eventually used Python to automatically split a larger pdf of all the cards into a bunch of individual images. I also got to flex some of my creative writing muscles for this project, as each character has their own little unique backstory and fits into the world I built for the game.

The card design is minimalist, so I can focus on prototyping lots of cards fast, make sure they fit nicely into the lore, encourage interesting gameplay, and are balanced.

Eventually I will make a digital, online version of this game, but that's on the backburner for now.

#### Chess Dynasties, Digital Board Game = Artist & Designer: 
###### JUNE 2018 - PRESENT
This game has an interesting relationship with Super Fortress, in that I met some people online who were already discussing working on a digital version of a very similar game.  My version of the game has since diverged, and is much different, but I am still very much invested in this project.  For this project I have learned some C# with Unity, and continue to expand on my skills in that language.

#### Twilight Labyrinth, Digital Game = Programmer
###### 2019 APRIL 13 - 14
Twilight Labyrinth is a single player turn based adventure game focused on the audio immersion of the player. The game is tailored towards blind or visually impaired gamers, and can be played based on sound alone. The game was developed in 24 hours at Technight 2019 Hackathon in Brooklyn, NY.

#### Mail Matcher, Email Based Dating App = Developer
###### 2019 APRIL 26 - 27
Though this was an independent project, I wanted to replicate the intense workflow I experienced at the 2019 Technight Hackathon (minus the all-nighter)...  I worked on the game for most of the first day, and then finished up in the morning of the following day.

This project has some interesting goals in addition to wanting to complete it quickly.  I designed the project with decentralization in mind (an important feature of cryptocurrency that excites me).  Anyone can host a server for the dating app, by just downloading and running the python code, after inputting their email address and password.  One thing I hope to address in the future, would be a coordination of the servers, to form a larger collective database (currently people can only be matched with other people from the same host).

Another interesting interesting thing I implemented was in my match making algorithm.  In addition to matching people based on gender and other stuff, I used a statistical analysis of their word choices and sentence structure.  The algorithm compares various numbers like average word length, usage of the lowercase ' i ', and average sentence length, of two potential matches.

Lots more information, and a more verbose summary in the readme:
